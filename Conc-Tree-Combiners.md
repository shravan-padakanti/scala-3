In this lecture we will implement combiners based on conc-trees that we introduced in the previous lectures called conc-buffers.

## Conc Buffers

The `ConcBuffer` appends elements into an array of size `k`. When the array gets full, it is stored into a `Chunk` node and added into the Conc-tree.

```scala
class ConcBuffer[T: ClassTag](val k: Int, private var conc: Conc[T]) {
    private var chunk: Array[T] = new Array(k)
    private var chunkSize: Int = 0
```
The `+=` operation in most cases just adds an element to the chunk array:
```scala
    final def +=(elem: T): Unit = {
        if (chunkSize >= k) expand()
        chunk(chunkSize) = elem
        chunkSize += 1
    }
```

Occasionally, the `chunk` array becomes full, and needs to be expanded.

## Chunk Nodes
Chunk nodes are similar to Single nodes, but instead of a single element, they hold an array of elements.

```scala
class Chunk[T](val array: Array[T], val size: Int) extends Conc[T] {
    def level = 0
}
```

## Expanding the Conc Buffer
The expand method inserts the chunk into the Conc-tree, and allocates a new chunk:

```scala
private def expand() {
    conc = appendLeaf(conc, new Chunk(chunk, chunkSize))
    chunk = new Array(k)
    chunkSize = 0
}
```

## Combine Method

The combine method is straightforward:

```scala
final def combine(that: ConcBuffer[T]): ConcBuffer[T] = {
    val combinedConc = this.result <> that.result
    new ConcBuffer(k, combinedConc)
}
```
Above, the combine method relies on the result method to obtain the Conc-trees from both buffers.

## Result Method
The result method packs chunk array into the tree and returns the resulting tree:

```scala
def result: Conc[T] = {
    conc = appendLeaf(conc, new Chunk(chunk, chunkSize))
    conc
}
```

Summary:

* O(log n) combine concatenation
* fast O(1) += operation
* O(1) result operation

### Conc Buffer Demo

Demo â€“ run the same benchmark as we did for the ArrayCombiner:
```scala
xs.par.aggregate(new ConcBuffer[String])(_ += _, _ combine _).result
```
